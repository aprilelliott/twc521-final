                <p>UFC legend Chuck Liddell needed branding and advertising for his new supplement line, "Ultimate Iceman Supplements." Working closely with his team, multiple versions of the logo were created in Adobe Illustrator, and he and his team ultimately approved the logo shown upper left.</p>

                    This supplement company out of Tracy, California, was also a start up company in need of a logo. They didn't identify any particular direction for the project, so there was freedom to experiment with colors, text and images. The final design was developed in Adobe Illustrator and incorporates an abstract runner behind a bold word mark. </p>

                <p>This nutrition company located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, was also a start up company when they reached out for assistance with branding. The only request was to use dark blue and gold. I created a mountain peak out of the "A" in Peak, and then added a streak of gold behind the word mark to break up the white space, creating a sense of energy, and mimicking the peak of the "A".  </p>

                <p>SLOmow, operating in San Luis Obispo, is a professional brush clearing company that was in need of a logo revamp. A variety of concepts were developed, some with green strokes creating a grassy element. However, in the end, the final logo would be without grass, a hilly terrain taking its place. The final logo is comprised of two different font types creating contrast to give each part its own emphasis.  </p>
